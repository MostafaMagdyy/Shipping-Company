# Cargo Delivery Simulation System

**Welcome to the Cargo Delivery Simulation System project!** This simulation system provides an immersive learning experience to master key software engineering concepts, with a primary focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, encapsulation, inheritance, and proficiency in data structures.

## Overview

The Cargo Delivery Simulation System is designed to deepen your understanding of OOP concepts and data structures by simulating a dynamic cargo delivery environment. Through this project, you will explore real-world problem-solving, design modular systems, and enhance your programming skills.

## Project Objectives

1. **OOP Mastery**
   - **Polymorphism:** Implement function overloading, operator overloading, and dynamic polymorphism using virtual functions.
   - **Inheritance:** Establish a clear hierarchical structure by mastering the use of inheritance for modeling relationships between cargo-related entities.
   - **Encapsulation:** Practice encapsulation by controlling access to class data through access specifiers and designing intuitive interfaces for client code.

2. **Data Structures Proficiency**
   - **Selection of Appropriate Data Structures:** Analyze the cargo delivery problem and choose suitable data structures for efficient information management.
   - **Operations and Complexities:** Implement operations on chosen data structures, understanding and documenting their time and space complexities.

3. **Problem Solving**
   - **Deriving Design from Unstructured Descriptions:** Develop the ability to interpret unstructured problem descriptions and derive a well-structured design.
   - **Modularization:** Practice modularizing designs, breaking down complex problems into manageable, independent components.

4. **Implementation Skills**
   - **Object-Oriented C++ Programming:** Enhance C++ programming skills through the implementation of a non-trivial task using object-oriented principles.
   - **Data Structure Implementation:** Apply theoretical knowledge about data structures into practical implementation, gaining hands-on experience in constructing and managing data efficiently.
